# Code of Conduct StoreFront X Open Source


Our goal is to build a community of developers around StoreFront X Open Source, helping each other solve different issues and working together to create an innovative product that we all enjoy using. 


We would like our community to be productive, inspiring, and friendly and for everyone to feel comfortable in it, regardless of their background, origin, or experience. We are all different and may have completely different perspectives on the same problem. Just because someone has a different opinion on an issue doesn't necessarily mean they are wrong. We like to keep discussions as constructive as possible, without insults or personal attacks. 


This Code of Conduct sets expectations for the behavior of community participants, helps create a positive atmosphere, and protects all participants. It articulates the principles we support and the behaviors we want to avoid.


Our basic rules and principles include the following:
1. Be kind and welcoming. Maintain a positive atmosphere. Avoid poor behavior. 
2. Respect others and be patient. Try to understand different opinions. Blaming each other doesn't help.
3. Do not insult or harass others. Avoid personal attacks and any kind of threats.
4. Be careful in the words you choose. Avoid hate speech or hateful conduct. Do not put down or harm others. Exaggeration and parody are fine:)
5. Do not discriminate others because of their background, identity, experience, beliefs, sex, orientation, age, disabilities, etc.
6. Do not share any sexual or violent content.
7. Be professional. Keep in mind that others will use your work, and you depend on their work. Think about the consequences of your actions.
8. Learn from mistakes. Try to help to resolve issues.
9. Respect the topic of each channel. Do not spam others or the admins.
10. Do not share false or misleading information. This content may be removed.
11. Do not mislead our support team. Do not send multiple/repetitive/false questions. 
12. Avoid self-promo (ads, invites, etc.) unless the admins have approved it.
13. Do not share content that violates anyone's intellectual property or other rights.
14. Do not take any action to cause harm or gain unauthorized access to another user's account, network, or system (distributing malware, phishing, and other hacking stuff).
15. Do not use self-bots or user-bots. Each account must be associated with a human.


This is not a complete list of the rules and principles we believe in. Please consider this more as basic guidelines to make us feel comfortable within the community and to work well together here. 


This Code applies to everyone across all communication channels our community uses (Slack, mail, Github, etc.). 


If you come across any activity that violates the code, please report it to macura@storefrontx.io.
