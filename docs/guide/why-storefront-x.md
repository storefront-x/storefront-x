# Why Storefront X?

When creating new software, it's rarely written from scratch. Instead, libraries, frameworks and/or platforms are used which help us to get up and running. This is the right approach if we are constrained by time and/or budget. But there is one catch.

**Using third party code is great, until it isn't.**

One one hand, third party libraries and frameworks provide us with with features, utilities and tools which can accelerate development of new project. But they also constrain us by the features they provide. Sooner or later, every project will require functionality which is not provided or supported by the underlying framework. Sooner or later, every project will outgrow its underlying framework. If such event occurs, frameworks and libraries stop being accelerators and start slowing us down.

Storefront X is made from the ground up to solve this issue. Storefront X uses highly modular architecture in which everything can be extended, overridden or changed. This allows Storefront X to provide application authors with a tons of functionality while never limiting or slowing down the application development.

**Storefront X improves time-to-market, lowers project costs and increases code reusability.**
