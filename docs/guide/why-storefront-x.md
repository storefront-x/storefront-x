# Why Storefront X?

Imagine this situation: you need to develop new web application. You don't want to start from scratch so you search for framework that you can use to build your application. You compare multiple frameworks and choose the one that suits you the best. You start developing and in the beginning everything is great. The framework is well thought out, full of features and great documentations. But sooner or later you will want to add feature that the framework doesn't support. Or you want to modify some functionality of the framework. Now what? Create a ticket and wait until the developers publish new version? Or start hacking the framework and bending it in gnarly ways to somehow make it work?

**Using third party code is great until it isn't.**

Storefront X is built from scratch to allow for super easy addition/modification/removal of any feature. Storefront X uses modular architecture which allows modules to override each other. So adding and removing features is just as easy as enabling and disabling modules. And if some functionality in some module doesn't suit your needs, you can override it with your own module.

This approach allows for unparalleled flexibility while also allowing Storefront X to ship default functionality, themes and utilities.
