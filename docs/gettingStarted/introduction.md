# Introduction

You are reading the documentation for Storefront X e-commerce modular framework.

Our main goal as developers is sustainability for complex projects, coupled with great developer experience supported by a large test-suite. Storefront X is made from the ground up to achieve this goal. We designed a framework with highly modular architecture in which everything can be extended, overridden or changed. This allows Storefront X to provide application authors with a ton of functionality while never limiting or slowing down the application development.

**Storefront X improves time-to-market, lowers project costs and increases code reusability.**
