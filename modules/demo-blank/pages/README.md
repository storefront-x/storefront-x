# Pages

The pages directory contains page components and layout components for your application.
Name of the components generally correspond to the URL under which they will be accessible.
So `index.vue` will be available under the `/` URL and `counter.vue` will be available under the `/counter` URL.

`$layout.vue` is special component representing the application layout.
